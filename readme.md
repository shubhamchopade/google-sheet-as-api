## Google Sheet as API

1. Publish the sheet to web from 'file'.
2. Get the spreadsheet id from the URL
3. Replace the 'spreatsheetID' by the copied URL from step 2.
spreadsheets.google.com/feeds/worksheets/spreadsheetID/public/basic?alt=json
4. You will get a JSON output from which the data is accessible.

### Congratulations :)
